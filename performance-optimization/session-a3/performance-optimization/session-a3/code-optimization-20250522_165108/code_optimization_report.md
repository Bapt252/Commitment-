   - Added intelligent caching strategies
   - Created performance monitoring decorators

## ðŸš€ PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### CV Parsing Pipeline Optimizations
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Instant response for cached CVs
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent text extraction and AI analysis
- **Smart Chunking**: Optimized prompt sizes for faster API calls
- **Regex + AI Hybrid**: Fast regex patterns with AI fallback

### Matching Service Optimizations
- **Vectorized Similarity**: Batch processing with scikit-learn
- **Intelligent Caching**: Skills overlap and similarity caching
- **Optimized Queries**: Single batch queries instead of loops
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Weighted scoring with cached factors

### Async/Await Benefits
- **Concurrent I/O**: Database and API calls run in parallel
- **Connection Reuse**: Persistent sessions for HTTP connections
- **Thread Pool Integration**: CPU-intensive work in thread pools
- **Semaphore Limiting**: Controlled concurrency to prevent overwhelm

## ðŸ“Š EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS

### Response Time Improvements
| Endpoint | Before (avg) | After (target) | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| CV Parse | 2000ms | 1500ms | -25% |
| Job Match | 1500ms | 1125ms | -25% |
| Bulk Match | 8000ms | 6000ms | -25% |
| Health Check | 100ms | 75ms | -25% |

### Memory Optimization Benefits
- **Leak Prevention**: Automatic detection and cleanup
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup of HTTP/DB connections
- **Garbage Collection**: Optimized GC cycles
- **Weak References**: Prevention of circular references

### Caching Strategy Improvements
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Redis + in-memory for different data types
- **Smart TTL**: Different expiration times per data type
- **Cache Warming**: Pre-loading of common computations
- **Hit Rate Optimization**: Expected >80% cache hit rate

## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Key Code Optimizations
